# StonePaperScissor_in_python
a simple rock paper scissors game 
currently it is using the random logic for one player game, hoping for more improvements
for making a move just type your desired on stone, paper or scissor
used looping so you can map your score ,type q or quit to end the game at any time (not case sensitive)

Please feel free to fork it and raise issues if you think that something could be done better. Happy coding!!
